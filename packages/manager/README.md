# @philter/manager

This project was bootstrapped with [@vite/create-app](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-app) 2.3.0.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
The dev server proxies API requests to KoLmafia's repay browser, which should be running in a different port (see [`vite.config.ts`](./vite.config.ts)).

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### `yarn serve`

Boots up a local static server that serves the built app. You can use this _after_ running `yarn build` to check if the production build looks OK.
